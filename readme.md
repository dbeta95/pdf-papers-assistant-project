**DocuMentor**

Academic research and writing can be incredibly challenging, especially for young students. Reading through countless papers and recalling specific details later during the writing process can be arduous.

DocuMentor is here to make your academic journey easier! It can answer questions about your articles, making it simple to find the information you need. It's also a fantastic tool to help you understand new concepts.

This project was implemented as part of the [Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp) - a free course about LLMs and RAG.
